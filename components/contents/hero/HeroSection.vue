      ðŸ‘‹ This is Dom, a software engineer whoâ€™s been piecing together the tech
      puzzle for a good while now. I like to think of myself as someone who
      connects the dots and turns ideas into reality.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Iâ€™m not just about coding. Iâ€™m a problem solver at heart, and I love
      figuring things out, whether itâ€™s tech-related or not. When Iâ€™m not
      working, Iâ€™m probably out exploring new places, trying different foods,
      and collecting stories from the people I meet.
